Attended a coding bake off at Kit CRM for a revamp of their homepage in 4 hours!

This is the first iteration of Kit's homepage designed in 4 hours from using Bootstrap.

Based on logic in design and the appeal to the audience, I was selected for runner up.

I got honest feedback from the CEO himself and very excited to continually make iterations for this project as I strive to be the best at what I do!
